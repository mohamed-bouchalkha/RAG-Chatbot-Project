--- Content from  ---Fes (/fɛs/; Arabic: فاس, romanized: fās) or Fez (/fɛz/) is a city in northern inland Morocco and the capital of the Fez-Meknes administrative region. It is one of the largest cities in Morocco, with a population of 1.256 million, according to the 2024 census.[2] Located to the northwest of the Atlas Mountains, it is surrounded by hills and the old city is centered around the Fez River (Oued Fes) flowing from west to east. Fez has been called the "Mecca of the West" and the "Athens of Africa". It is also considered the spiritual and cultural capital of Morocco.Founded under Idrisid rule during the 8th–9th centuries CE, Fez initially consisted of two autonomous and competing settlements. Successive waves of mainly Arab immigrants from Ifriqiya (Tunisia) and al-Andalus (Spain/Portugal) in the early 9th century gave the nascent city its Arab character. After the downfall of the Idrisid dynasty, other empires came and went until the 11th century when the Almoravid Sultan Yusuf ibn Tashfin united the two settlements into what is today's Fes el-Bali (lit. 'Old Fes') quarter, a.k.a. Medina of Fez. Under Almoravid rule, the city gained a reputation for religious scholarship and mercantile activity.Fez reached its zenith in the Marinid era (13th–15th centuries), regaining its status as political capital. Numerous new madrasas and mosques were constructed, many of which survive today, while other structures were restored. These buildings are counted among the hallmarks of Moorish and Moroccan architectural styles. In 1276 the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub also founded the royal administrative district of Fes Jdid (lit. 'New Fez'), where the Royal Palace (Dar al-Makhzen) is still located today, to which extensive gardens were later added. During this period the Jewish population of the city grew and the Mellah (Jewish quarter) was formed on the south side of this new district. After the overthrow of the Marinid dynasty, the growth of Fez stalled and the city subsequently competed with Marrakesh for political and cultural influence. It became the capital again under the 'Alawi dynasty up until 1912.The city consists of two old medina quarters, Fes el-Bali and Fes Jdid, and the much larger modern urban Ville Nouvelle area founded during the French colonial era. The Medina of Fez is listed as a World Heritage Site and is one of the world's largest and oldest urban pedestrian zones (car-free areas). It contains the University of al-Qarawiyyin which was founded in 857 and is the oldest continuously functioning institute of higher education in the world. It also contains the Chouara Tannery from the 11th century, one of the oldest tanneries in the world.The name of the city in Arabic is فاس Fās (or ڢاس in traditional Maghrebi script), from which the English names Fez, Fès, and Fas are derived. According to some traditions, the city's name comes from the Arabic word فأس Faʾs, meaning pickaxe. Various legends have been reported to explain this etymology. One tells the story of a gold pickaxe found on site during the city's construction, while another claims that Idris I used a silver and gold pickaxe to dig alongside his workers.[4]: 26 [5][6] Another account reported by Ibn Abi Zar claims that an ancient city named "Sef" had previously existed on the site and that Idris I reversed the letters of this name to create the name "Fes".[4]: 26–27 [5] It was also suggested that the name is a Znati form of "afas" meaning "ruins", as Fez may have been built on the ruins of an older city. A further hypothesis suggests that it comes from "Fazaz", which is the name of a nearby region, or from "فحص (faẖs)" meaning "plain wide land".[7]During the rule of the Idrisid dynasty (788 to 974), Fez consisted of two cities: Fās, founded by Idris I,[8] and al-ʿĀliyá, founded by his son, Idris II. During this period the capital city was known as al-ʿĀliyá, with the name Fās being reserved for the separate site on the other side of the river. No Idrisid coins have been found with the name Fez, only al-ʿĀliyá and al-ʿĀliyá Madinat Idris. It is not known whether the name al-ʿĀliyá ever referred to both urban areas. The two cities were united in 1070 and the name Fās was used for the combined site.[9]The city was first founded in 789 as Madinat Fas on the southeast bank of the Jawhar River (now known as the Fez River) by Idris I, founder of the Idrisid dynasty. Idris I was an Hasanid Sharif from Arabia who was forced to flee the Hejaz after a failed revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate, eventually moving to northern Morocco and conquereing much of the area.[10][11] His son, Idris II,[12] built a settlement called al-ʿĀliyá on the opposing river bank in 809 and moved his capital here from Walili (Volubilis).[13]: 35 [14]: 35 [15]: 83 The early population was composed mostly of Berbers, along with hundreds of Arab warriors from Kairouan who made up Idris II's entourage.[13]: 35, 41 [15]: 82Arab immigration to Fez increased afterwards. Andalusi families of mixed Arab and Iberian descent,[16] who were expelled from Córdoba after a rebellion in 817–818 against al-Hakam I, were one major component of the immigrant population. These families mainly settled in Madinat Fas.[13]: 46–47 The immigrants from Kairouan and al-Andalus gave the city its Arabic character and would subsequently give their name to the districts of 'Adwat Al-Andalus [ar] and 'Adwat al-Qarawiyyin [ar].[17]: 51 The city also had a prominent Jewish community, probably consisting of Zenata Berbers who had previously converted to Judaism, as well as a small remaining Christian population for a time. The Jews were especially concentrated in a northeastern district of al-ʿĀliyá, known as Funduq el-Yihoudi (near the present-day Bab Guissa gate).[13]: 42–44Following the death of Idris II in 828 the region was divided among his sons. The eldest, Muhammad, received Fez, but some of his brothers attempted to break away from his leadership, resulting in an internecine conflict. Although the Idrisid realm was eventually reunified and enjoyed a period of peace under Ali ibn Muhammad and Yahya ibn Muhammad, it fell into decline again in the late 9th century.[18]In the 10th century, the city was contested by the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimid Caliphate of Ifriqiya (Tunisia), who ruled the city through a host of Zenata clients.[15]: 88–91 [18][21]: 63–64, 74–75 The Fatimids took the city in 927 and expelled the Idrisids definitively, after which their Miknasa (one of the Zenata tribes) were installed there. The city, along with much of northern Morocco, continued to change hands between the proxies of Córdoba and the proxies of the Fatimids for many decades. Following another successful invasion by Buluggin ibn Ziri in 979 and a brief period of Fatimid control, the forces of Al-Mansur of Cordoba managed to retake the region again, expelling the Fatimids permanently.[18] From 980 (or from 986[22][13]), Fez was ruled by a Zenata dynasty from the Maghrawa tribe, who were allies of the Caliphate of Córdoba. They maintained this control even after the Caliphate's collapse in the early 11th century and until the arrival of the Almoravids.[14]: 16 [22][15]: 91Fez continued to grow under Zenata control, even though conflicts between its two settlements, Madinat Fas and al-ʿĀliyá, flared up during periods of political rivalry. Ziri ibn Atiyya, the first ruler of the new dynasty, had a troubled reign.[13]: 50 However, Ibn Atiyya's descendant Dunas ibn Hamama, ruling between 1037 and 1049, was responsible for improving the city's infrastructure.[23] He developed much of Fez's water supply system, which has largely survived up to the present day.[23][24] Other structures built in his time included hammams (bathhouses), mosques, and the first bridges over the Oued Bou Khrareb (mostly rebuilt in later eras).[13]: 51 [23][25][26] The two cities became increasingly integrated: the open space between the two was filled up by new houses and up to six bridges across the river allowed for easier passage between them.[4]: 36 A decade after Dunas, between 1059 and 1061, the two cities were ruled separately by two brothers who were rival Zenata emirs that fought with each other: al-ʿĀliyá was controlled by an emir named Al-Gisa and Madinat Fas was controlled by Al-Fetouh. Both brothers fortified their respective shores, and their names have been preserved in two of the city's gates to this day: Bab Guissa (or Bab Gisa) in the north and Bab Ftouh in the south.[27]: 31 [13]: 50, 53, 110In 1069–1070 (or possibly a few years later[22]), Fez was conquered by the Almoravids under Yusuf ibn Tashfin. In the same year of this conquest, Yusuf ibn Tashfin unified Madinat Fas and al-ʿĀliyá into one city. The walls dividing them were destroyed, bridges connecting them were built or renovated, and a new circuit of walls was constructed that encompassed both cities. A kasbah (Arabic term for "citadel") was built at the western edge of the city (just west of Bab Bou Jeloud today) to house the city's governor and garrison.[13]: 53 [24] Although the capital was moved to Marrakesh under the Almoravids, Fez acquired a reputation for Maliki legal scholarship and remained an important centre of trade and industry.[13]: 52–54 [14]: 17–18 Almoravid impact on the city's structure was such that Yusuf ibn Tashfin is sometimes considered to be the second founder of Fez.[28]In 1145 the Almohad leader Abd al-Mu'min besieged and conquered the city during the Almohad overthrow of the Almoravids. Due to the ferocious resistance they encountered from the local population, the Almohads demolished the city's fortifications.[13]: 55 [24] However, due to Fez's continuing economic and military importance, the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur ordered the reconstruction of the ramparts.[27]: 36 [24]: 606 The walls were completed by his successor Muhammad al-Nasir in 1204,[27]: 36 giving them their definitive shape and establishing the perimeter of Fes el-Bali to this day.[13]: 56 [24][29]: 19 The Almohads built the Kasbah Bou Jeloud on the site of the former Almoravid kasbah[13]: 56 and also built the first kasbah occupying the site of the current Kasbah an-Nouar.[4]: 72 [27]: 109 Not all the land within the city walls was densely inhabited; much of it was still relatively open and was occupied by crops and gardens used by the inhabitants.[29]: 19 During the 12th century, the city was one of the largest in the world,[30][31] with an estimated population of 200,000.[30] By 1200, Fez and Cairo had probably become the largest Muslim cities.[32]In 1250, Fez regained its status as the capital under the Marinid dynasty. The city reached its golden age in the Marinid period.[33]: 16 [13]: 61–78 [14]: 20 In 1276, an anti-Marinid revolt resulted in a massacre of the Jewish community that was stopped by the intervention of the ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub.[34][35] Following the revolt, Abu Yusuf Yaqub founded Fes Jdid as the new administrative and military centre. Under the Marinids, many of the principal monuments in the medina were built and the city established its reputation as an important intellectual centre.[13]: 61–78 [36] Between 1271 and 1357 seven madrasas were built, which are among the best examples of Moroccan architecture and some of the most richly decorated monuments in Fez.[37]: 285–289, 291–293 [38][39]: 312–314The Jewish quarter of Fez, the Mellah, was created in Fes Jdid at some point during the Marinid period. The exact date and circumstances of its formation are not firmly established,[40][35] but many scholars date the transfer of the Jewish population from Fes el-Bali to the new Mellah to the 15th century, a period of political tension and instability. In particular, Jewish sources describe the transfer as a consequence of the rediscovery of Idris II's body in the heart of the city in 1437, which caused the surrounding area—if not the entire city—to acquire a holy (haram) status, requiring that non-Muslims be removed from the area.[40][41][42][43] The Moroccan Jewish community had initially consisted of indigenous local Jews (known as the Toshavim) but these were joined by Western Sephardic Jews fleeing from the Iberian Peninsula (known as the Megorashim) in subsequent generations, especially after the 1492 expulsion of Jews from Spain and 1496 expulsion of Jews from Portugal.[44]The 1465 Moroccan revolt overthrew the last Marinid sultan. In 1472 the Wattasids, another Zenata dynasty which had previously served as viziers under the Marinid sultans, succeeded as rulers of Morocco from Fez.[21]: 114–115 [45] They perpetuated the structure of the Marinid state and continued its policies, but were unable to control all of Morocco.[33]: 15 [21]: 207–209 They did not contribute significantly to the physical fabric of Fez.[46]In the 16th century the Saadis, a dynasty claiming prophetic heritage, rose to power in southern Morocco and challenged the Wattasids. Around the same time, the Ottoman Empire came close to Fez after its conquest of Algeria. In January 1549, the Saadi sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh took Fez and ousted the last Wattasid sultan Ali Abu Hassun. The Wattasids later retook the city in 1554 with Ottoman support, but this reconquest was short-lived and later that same year the Wattasids were decisively defeated by the Saadis.[17]: 157 The Ottomans attempted to invade Morocco after the assassination of Mohammed ash-Sheikh in 1558, but were stopped by his son Abdallah al-Ghalib at the Battle of Wadi al-Laban north of Fez.[17]: 158 After the death of Abdallah al-Ghalib a new power struggle emerged. Abd al-Malik, Abdallah's brother, captured Fez with Ottoman support and ousted his nephew Abu Abdullah from the throne. This led to the Battle of Wadi al-Makhazin (also known as Battle of the Three Kings) in which Abd al-Malik's army defeated an invading Portuguese army, ensuring Moroccan independence. Abd al-Malik was killed during the battle and was succeeded by Ahmad al-Mansur (r. 1578–1603).[47]The Saadis, who used Marrakesh again as their capital, did not lavish much attention on Fez, with the exception of the ornate ablutions pavilions added to the Qarawiyyin Mosque's courtyard during their time.[48]: 70 Perhaps as a result of persistent tensions with the city's inhabitants, the Saadis built a number of new forts and bastions around the city which appear to have been aimed at keeping control over the local population.[a]After the long reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, the Saadi state fell into civil war between his sons and potential successors. Fez became a rival seat of power for a number of brothers vying against other family members ruling from Marrakesh. Both cities changed hands multiple times until the internecine conflict finally ended in 1627.[47][50] Despite the reunification of the realm after 1627, the Saadis were in full decline and Fez had already suffered considerably from the repeated conquests and reconquests during the conflict.[22] In 1641, Muhammad al-Haj of the Sanhaja Dilā' Sufi order occupied Fez.[51]: 88 The time was particularly difficult for Fessi Jews.[51]: 88It was only when the founder of the 'Alawi dynasty, Moulay Rashid, took Fez in 1666 that the city saw a revival and became the capital again, albeit briefly.[29]: 25 Moulay Rashid set about restoring the city after a long period of neglect. He built the Kasbah Cherarda (also known as the Kasbah al-Khemis) to the north of Fes Jdid in order to house a large part of his tribal troops.[13]: 84 [29]: 25 He also restored or rebuilt what became known as the Kasbah an-Nouar, which became the living quarters of his followers from the Tafilalt region (the 'Alawi dynasty's ancestral home).[13]: 84 [4]: 72–73 Moulay Rashid also built a large new madrasa, the Cherratine Madrasa, in 1670.[38]After Rashid's death, Fez underwent another dark period. Moulay Isma'il, his successor, apparently disliked the city—possibly due to a rebellion there in his early reign—and chose nearby Meknès as his capital instead.[13]: 84 Although he did restore or rebuild some major monuments in the city, such as the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II, he also frequently imposed heavy taxes on the city's inhabitants and sometimes even forcibly transferred parts of its population to repopulate other cities in the country.[13]: 84–85 After his death, Morocco was plunged into anarchy and decades of conflict between his sons who vied to succeed him. Fez suffered particularly from repeated conflicts with the Udayas (or Oudayas), a guich tribe (vassal tribe serving as a garrison and military force) previously installed in the Kasbah Cherarda by Moulay Isma'il. Sultan Moulay Abdallah, who reigned intermittently during this period and used Fez as a capital, was initially welcomed in 1728–29 as an enemy of the Udayas, but relations between him and the city's population quickly soured due to his choice of governor. He immediately built a separate fortified palace in the countryside, Dar Dbibegh, where he resided instead. For nearly three more decades the city remained in more or less perpetual conflict with both the Udayas and the 'Alawi sultans.[13]: 85–86Starting with the reign of Moulay Muhammad ibn Abdallah, between 1757 and 1790, the country stabilized and Fez finally regained its fortunes. Although its status was partly shared with Marrakesh, it remained the capital of Morocco for the rest of the 'Alawi period up to the 20th century.[13]: 88 [14]: 25–26 The 'Alawis continued to rebuild or restore various monuments and undertook a series of extensions to the Royal Palace.[38][52] The sultans and their entourages also became more and more closely associated with the elites of Fez and other urban centers, with the ulama (religious scholars) of Fez being particularly influential. After Moulay Slimane's death, powerful families from Fez became the main players of the country's political and intellectual scene.[17]: 242–247The Tijani Sufi order, started by Ahmad al-Tijani (d. 1815), has had its spiritual center in Fez since al-Tijani moved here from Algeria in 1789.[17]: 244 The order spread quickly among the literary elite of North West Africa and its ulama had significant religious, intellectual, and political influence in Fez and beyond.[53] Until the 19th century the city was the only source of fezzes (also known as the tarboosh).[12]The last major change to Fez's topography before the 20th century was made during the reign of Moulay Hassan I (1873–1894), who finally connected Fes Jdid and Fes el-Bali by building a walled corridor between them.[13]: 89 [29]: 25–26 New gardens and summer palaces, used by the royals and the capital's high society, were built within the corridor, such as the Jnan Sbil Gardens and the Dar Batha palace.[13]: 89–90 [52] Moulay Hassan also expanded the old Royal Palace itself, extending its entrance up to the current location of the Old Mechouar while adding the New Mechouar, along with the Dar al-Makina, to the north. The expansion separated the Moulay Abdallah neighbourhood to the northwest from the rest of Fes Jdid.[52]Fez played a central role in the Hafidhiya, the brief civil war that erupted when Abdelhafid challenged his brother Abdelaziz for the throne. The ulama of Fez, led by the Sufi modernist Muhammad Bin Abdul-Kabir Al-Kattani, offered their conditioned support to Abd al-Hafid, which turned the tide of the conflict.[54][55] Abdelaziz was defeated in the Battle of Marrakesh in 1908.[54]: 76–78 Abdelhafid's reign soon deteriorated and in early 1911 the sultan was besieged in Fez by the tribes of the Middle Atlas. Abdelhafid appealed for French help and a French force under Colonel Charles Émile Moinier [fr] arrived in Fez on 21 May and established a command centre at Dar Dbibegh.[22][17]: 313 [54]: 78In 1912, French colonial rule was instituted over Morocco following the Treaty of Fes. One immediate consequence was the 1912 riots in Fez, a popular uprising which included deadly attacks targeting Europeans as well as native Jewish inhabitants in the Mellah, followed by an even deadlier repression.[56][57] The first French resident general, Hubert Lyautey, decided to move the administrative capital of the Protectorate to Rabat in 1912–1913, which has remained the capital ever since.[58]: 149 [59][60]A number of social and physical changes took place during this period and across the 20th century. Starting under Lyautey, one important policy with long-term consequences was the decision to largely forego redevelopment of existing historic walled cities in Morocco and to intentionally preserve them as sites of historic heritage, still known today as "medinas". Instead, the French administration built new modern cities (the Villes Nouvelles) just outside the old cities, where European settlers largely resided with modern Western-style amenities. This was part of a larger "policy of association" adopted by Lyautey which favoured various forms of indirect colonial rule by preserving local institutions and elites, in contrast with other French colonial policies that had favoured "assimilation".[61][62][63] The Ville Nouvelle also became known as Dar Dbibegh by Moroccans, as the former palace of Moulay Abdallah was located in the same area.[22]The creation of the separate French Ville Nouvelle to the west had a wider impact on the entire city's development.[63] While new colonial policies preserved historic monuments, they stalled urban development in heritage areas.[61] Scholar Janet Abu-Lughod has argued that these policies created a kind of urban "apartheid" between the indigenous Moroccan urban areas, who were forced to remain stagnant in terms of urban development and architectural innovation, and the new, mainly European-inhabited planned cities, which expanded to occupy lands formerly used by Moroccans outside the city.[64][65]: 165–166 [61] This separation was partly softened, however, by wealthy Moroccans who started moving into the Ville Nouvelles during this period.[66][14]: 26 By contrast, the old city (medina) of Fez was increasingly settled by poorer rural migrants from the countryside.[14]: 26Fez also played a role in the Moroccan nationalist movement and in protests against the French colonial regime. Many Moroccan nationalists received their education at the Al-Qarawiyyin University and some of their informal political networks were established thanks to this shared educational background.[67]: 140, 146 In July 1930, the students and other inhabitants protested against the Berber Dahir, decreed by the French authorities in May of that year.[68][67]: 143–144 In 1937, the Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque and R'cif Mosque were rallying points for demonstrations against a violent crackdown on Moroccan protesters in the nearby city of Meknes, which ended with French troops being deployed across Fes el-Bali, including at the mosques themselves.[21]: 387–389 [67]: 168 Towards the end of World War II, Moroccan nationalists gathered in Fez to draft a demand for independence which they submitted to the Allies on 11 January 1944. This resulted in the arrest of nationalist leaders followed by the violent suppression of protests across many cities, including Fez.[69][67]: 255After Morocco regained its independence in 1956, many of the trends begun under colonial rule continued and accelerated. Much of Fez's bourgeois classes moved to the growing metropolises of Casablanca and the capital, Rabat.[14]: 26 [70]: 40 The Jewish population was particularly depleted, either moving to Casablanca or emigrating to countries like France, Canada, and Israel. Although the population of the city grew, it did so only slowly up until the late 1960s, when the pace of growth finally accelerated.[69]: 216 Throughout this period Fez nonetheless remained the country's third largest urban center.[14]: 26 [69]: 216 Between 1971 and 2000, the population of the city roughly tripled from 325,000 to 940,000, making it the second largest city in Morocco.[15]: 376 The Ville Nouvelle became the locus of further development, with new peripheral neighbourhoods–with inconsistent housing quality–spreading outwards around it.[69] In 1963 the University of Al-Qarawiyyin was reorganized as a state university,[71] while a new public university, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, was founded in 1975 in the Ville Nouvelle.[72] In 1981, the old city, consisting of Fes el-Bali and Fes Jdid, was classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[73]Social inequalities and economic precarity were accentuated during the repressive reign of King Hassan II and the period known as the Years of Lead (roughly 1975–1990).[54]: 170 Fez was strongly affected by unemployment and lack of housing. Austerity measures led to several riots and uprisings across other cities during the 1980s. On 14 December 1990, a general strike was called and led to protests and rioting by university students and youths in Fez. Buildings were burned and looted, including the Hôtel des Mérinides, a luxury hotel overlooking Fes el-Bali and dating to the time of Lyautey. Thousands were arrested and at least five were killed. The government promised to investigate and raise wages, though some of these measures were dismissed by the opposition.[15]: 377 [74][75][76]Today Fez remains a regional capital and one of Morocco's most important cities. Many of the former notable families of Fez still make up a large part of the country's political elite.[77] It is also a major tourism destination due to its historical heritage. In recent years efforts have been underway to restore and rehabilitate the old medina, ranging from the restoration of individual monuments to attempts to rehabilitate the Fez River.[78][79][80][81]The city is divided between its historic medina (the two walled districts of Fes el-Bali and Fes Jdid) and the now much larger Ville Nouvelle (New City) along with several outlying modern neighbourhoods. The old city is located in a valley along the banks of the Oued Fes (Fez River) just above its confluence with the larger Sebou River to the northeast.[13]: 32 [12] The Fez River takes its sources from the south and west and is split into various small canals which provide the historic city with water. These in turn empty into the Oued Bou Khrareb, the stretch of the river which passes through the middle of Fes el-Bali and separates the Qarawiyyin quarter from the Andalusian quarter.[13]: 232–235The new city occupies a plateau on the edge of the Saïs plain. The latter stretches out to the west and south and is occupied largely by farmland. Roughly 15 km south of Fes el-Bali is the region's main airport, Fes-Saïs. Further south is the town of Sefrou, while the city of Meknes, the next largest city in the region, is located to the southwest.[82][83]Northwest of the Middle Atlas mountains, Fez has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa) with a strong continental influence, shifting from relatively cool and wet in the winter to dry and hot days in the summer months between June and September. Rainfall can reach up to 800 mm (31 in) in good years. The winter highs typically reach around 15 °C (59 °F) and winter lows average about 4.5 °C (40 °F) in December–January. Frost is not uncommon during the winter period. The summer highs peak in July and August at approximately 34.5 °C (94 °F) with average lows of 18 °C (64 °F). The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are 46.7 °C (116 °F) and −8.2 °C (17 °F), respectively.Snowfall on average occurs once every 3 to 5 years. Fez recorded snowfall in three straight years in 2005, 2006 and 2007.[84][85]According to the 2024 national census, the population of the city of Fez was 1,256,172, which includes the municipalities of Fez proper and Méchouar Fès Jdid (New Fès).[2] Most of the population was Moroccan, but it also included 3,832 resident foreigners.[2] In the 2014 census, the foreigner population of Fez made up 4.2 percent of the total foreigner population of Morocco.[90] The predominant religion in Fez is Islam.[91] In the past the city had a large Jewish population, but as of 2001, less than 200 Jewish people remain.[92]The main spoken language in Fez is Arabic Darija (Arabic: الدارجة المغربية, lit. 'Moroccan vernacular'), a vernacular variety of Arabic. Like the inhabitants of other historical urban centers in Morocco, Ahl Fes (أهل فاس "the people of Fes," referring especially to old elite families) speak their own distinct dialect of Darija.[93] This Fessi dialect has traditionally been regarded as a prestige dialect over other forms of Moroccan Darija—particularly those seen as rural or 'arūbi (عروبي "of the rural Arabs")—due to its "association with the socio-economic power and dominance that its speakers enjoy at the national level," in the words of linguist Mohammed Errihani.[93][94]The Fessi dialect has traditionally had distinctive linguistic features. On the phonological level, these include the stereotypical use of a postalveolar approximant (like the American pronunciation of /ɹ/ in the word "red") in the place of a trilled [r] for /ر/, or a pharyngealized glottal stop or voiceless uvular plosive in the place of a voiced velar plosive ([g]) for /ق/.[93] On the morphosyntactic level, gender distinction in pronouns and verb inflections is neutralized in the second person singular.[93]Many of these features were shared with the other "pre-Hilalian" dialects in the region.[95]: 5, 24 [b] However, due to social and demographic changes that started in the 20th century such as mass rural migration into the city and the departure of most of the city's old urban elites to Casablanca, these old linguistic features are no longer dominant in the speech of Arabic speakers in Fez today.[96][95]: 5, 24 Prior to the departure of most Jewish residents in the second half of the 20th century, the Jewish community in Fez also spoke an Arabic dialect similar to the rest of the city.[95]: 24 [c]Modern Standard Arabic and Berber (Tamazight) are Morocco's two official state languages, although French is also widespread as a language of government and law.[97][98] The primary language of the literary traditions of Fes is Arabic.[99] While the daily spoken language is Darija (the Moroccan Arabic dialect), many people also speak French fluently. English is increasingly being learned by younger generations. Berber dialects are commonly spoken in the countryside around the city.[100]Historically, the city was one of Morocco's main centers of trade and craftsmanship. The tanning industry, for example, still embodied by tanneries of Fes el-Bali today, was a major source of exports and economic sustenance since the city's early history.[101] Up until the late 19th century, the city was the only place in the world which fabricated the fez hat.[12] The city's commerce was concentrated along its major streets, like Tala'a Kebira, and around the central bazaar known as the Kissariat al-Kifah from which many other souqs (markets) branched off.[13]: 112, 122–129 [14]: 52–56 The crafts industry continues to this day and is still focused in the old city, though largely reliant on tourism.[12]Today, the city's surrounding countryside, the fertile Saïss plains, is an important source of agricultural activity producing primarily cereals, beans, olives, and grapes, as well as raising livestock.[12][102] Tourism is also a major industry due to the city's UNESCO-listed historic medina.[12] Religious tourism is also present due to the old city's many major zawiyas (Islamic shrines), such as the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Zawiya of Sidi Ahmed al-Tijani, which attract both Moroccan and international (especially West African) pilgrims.[103] The city and the region still struggle with unemployment and economic precarity.[104]Two municipalities (Arabic: جماعتين حضريتين, French: communes) in the Fez Prefecture [ar] (Arabic: عمالة فاس) make up the city of Fez. Most of Fez is administered as the municipality of Fez, while the neighborhood of Fes Jdid is administered separately as the municipality of Méchouar Fès Jdid. Outside of the city, there are also three rural municipalities in the prefecture, Aïn Bida, Oulad Tayeb, and Sidi Harazem.[105]The municipality of Fez has an area of 94 square kilometres (36 sq mi) and recorded a population of 1,091,512 in the 2014 Moroccan census.[106] It is divided into six arrondissements (مقاطعات):The municipality of Fez is governed by a 91-member council, elected by direct universal suffrage every six years.[108][109] The arrondissements of Zouagha and Marininyine elect 17 councillors each; Jnan El Ouard and Saiss elect 16 councillors each; Agdal elects 13, and Fès-Médina elects 12.[110] Executive power is wielded by a president and ten vice-presidents, which are elected by the council.[111] In 2021, Abdeslam Bekkali, a member of the National Rally of Independents (RNI), succeeded Driss Azami El Idrissi as the new president of the municipality of Fez.[112]The municipality of Méchouar Fès Jdid consists of the neighborhood of Fes Jdid in the old city and forms an enclave within the municipality of Fez. Established in 1992, it is only 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi) in extent,[113] and recorded a population of 20,560 in the 2014 census.[106] The municipality possesses a special administrative status as the location of a royal palace (the Dar al-Makhzen or méchouar), one of four such municipalities (French: communes des méchouars) in Morocco. The other three are located in Casablanca, Marrakesh, and Rabat. These four municipalities are governed by special provisions that do not apply to ordinary municipalities.[107][114]The subdivisions of Fez Prefecture are grouped into two electoral districts, North Fez and South Fez, each of which elects four members to the House of Representatives. North Fez consists of the arrondissements of El Mariniyine, Fès-Médina, and Zouagha and the municipality of Méchouar Fès Jdid. South Fez consists of the other three arrondissements of Agdal, Jnan El Ouard, and Saiss, and the three rural municipalities outside the city of Fez.[115][116]The historic city of Fez consists of Fes el-Bali, the original city on both shores of the Oued Fes (River of Fez), and the smaller Fez Jdid, founded on higher ground to the west in the 13th century. It is distinct from Fez's now much larger Ville Nouvelle (new city). Fes el-Bali is the oldest continuously inhabited walled city in the Arab world,[117] and one of the largest and oldest urban pedestrian zones (car-free areas) in the whole world.[118][119][120] It is the site of the famous Qarawiyyin University and the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II, the most important religious and cultural sites, while Fez el-Jdid is the site of the 195 acre Royal Palace,[121] still used by the King of Morocco today. These two historic cities are linked together and are usually referred to together as the "medina" of Fez, though this term is sometimes applied more restrictively to Fes el-Bali only.[d]Fez is becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination and many non-Moroccans are now restoring traditional houses (riads and dars) as second homes in the medina. In 1981, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Medina of Fez a World Heritage site, describing it as "one of the most extensive and best conserved historic towns of the Arab-Muslim world."[73] It was the first site in Morocco to be granted this status.[123]There are numerous historic mosques in the medina, some of which are part of a madrasa or zawiya. Among the oldest still standing today are the Mosque of al-Qarawiyyin, founded in 857 and subsequently expanded,[48][124] the Mosque of the Andalusians founded in 859–860,[125][126]: 7 the Bou Jeloud Mosque from the late 12th century,[127] and possibly the Mosque of the Kasbah en-Nouar (which may have existed in the Almohad period but was likely rebuilt much later[4][13]). The very oldest mosques of the city, dating back to its first years, were the Mosque of the Sharifs (or Shurafa Mosque) and the Mosque of the Sheikhs (or al-Anouar Mosque); however, they no longer exist in their original form. The Mosque of the Sharifs was the burial site of Idris II and evolved into the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II that exists today, while the al-Anouar Mosque has left only minor remnants.[13]: 33A number of mosques from the important Marinid era, when Fes Jdid was created to be the capital of Morocco, include the Great Mosque of Fez el-Jdid from 1276, the Abu al-Hasan Mosque from 1341,[128] the Chrabliyine Mosque from 1342,[129] and the al-Hamra Mosque from around the same period.[130] The Bab Guissa Mosque was also founded in the reign of Abu al-Hasan (1331–1351), but modified in later centuries.[38] Other major mosques from the more recent 'Alawi period are the Moulay Abdallah Mosque, built in the early to mid-18th century with the tomb of Sultan Moulay Abdallah,[37]: 391 and the R'cif Mosque, built in the reign of Moulay Slimane (1793–1822).[131] The Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Zawiya of Sidi Ahmed al-Tijani include mosque areas as well, as do several other prominent zawiyas in the city.[4]: 118–131 [132][13]: 132–133 The Ville Nouvelle also includes many modern mosques, the largest of which is the Imam Malik Mosque which opened in 1994.[133][134][135]Elsewhere, the Jewish quarter (Mellah) is the site of the 17th-century Al-Fassiyin Synagogue and Ibn Danan Synagogue, as well multiple other lesser-known synagogues, though none of them are functioning today.[42] According to the World Jewish Congress there are only 150 Moroccan Jews remaining in Fes.[136] The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, the only Catholic church in Fez, was established in 1919 or 1920, during the French colonial period. The current building was constructed in 1928 and expanded in 1933. Today it is part of the Archdiocese of Rabat, and it was most recently restored in 2005.[137][138][139]The al-Qarawiyyin was established in 857 by Fatima al-Fihri, originally as a mosque, now a university.[140]: 9 [141]: 40 It is the oldest existing and continually operating degree-awarding educational institution in the world according to UNESCO and Guinness World Records.[142][73] The Marinid dynasty devoted great attention to the construction of madrasas following the Maliki school, resulting in the unprecedented prosperity of the city's religious institutions. The first madrasa built during the Marinid era was the Saffarin Madrasa in Fes el-Bali by Sultan Abu Yusuf in 1271.[39]: 312 Sultan Abu al-Hasan was the most prolific patron of madrasa construction, completing the Al-Attarine, Mesbahiyya and Sahrij Madrasas. His son Abu Inan Faris built the Bou Inania Madrasa, and by the time of his death, every major city in the Marinid Empire had at least one madrasa.[143] The library of al-Qarawiyyin, which holds a large collection of manuscripts from the medieval era, was also established under Marinid rule around 1350.[4]: 148 It is widely believed to be the oldest library in the world that is still open.[144] The largest madrasa in the medina is Cherratine Madrasa, which was commissioned by the 'Alawi sultan Al-Rashid in 1670 and is the only major non-Marinid foundation besides the Madrasa of al-Qarawiyyin.[145]Located in the heart of Fes el-Bali, the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II is a zawiya (a shrine and religious complex; also spelled zaouia), dedicated to and containing the tomb of Idris II (or Moulay Idris II when including his sharifian title) who is considered the main founder of the city of Fez.[12][146]: 51 Another well-known and important zawiya is the Zawiyia of Sidi Ahmed al-Tijani, which commemorates Sidi Ahmed al-Tijani, the founder of Tijaniyyah tariqa from the 18th century.[147] A number of zawiyas are scattered elsewhere across the city, many containing the tombs of important Sufi saints or scholars, such as the Zawiya of Sidi Abdelkader al-Fassi, the Zawiya of Sidi Ahmed esh-Shawi, and the Zawiya of Sidi Taoudi Ben Souda.[148]: 579 [149]: 62, 149The old city contains several major historic cemeteries which stand outside the walls of Fes el-Bali, namely the cemeteries of Bab Ftouh (the most significant), Bab Mahrouk, and Bab Guissa. Some include marabouts or domed structures, containing the tombs of local Muslim saints (often considered Sufis), for example the Marabout of Sidi Harazem in the Bab Ftouh Cemetery.[13]: 114, 468, 604 The ruins of the Marinid Tombs, built during the 14th century as a necropolis for the Marinid sultans, are close to the Bab Guissa Cemetery.[14]: 8The entire medina of Fez was heavily fortified with crenelated walls with watchtowers and gates, a pattern of urban planning which can be seen in Salé and Chellah as well.[143] The oldest sections of the walls today, on the north side of Fes el-Bali, date back to the Almohad period.[14]: 36 The gates of Fez, scattered along the circuit of walls, were guarded by the military detachments and shut at night.[143] Some of the main gates have existed, in different forms, since the earliest years of the city.[13]: 40–58 The oldest gates today, and historically the most important ones of Fes el-Bali, are Bab Mahrouk (in the west), Bab Guissa (in the northeast), and Bab Ftouh (in the southeast).[13]: 56, 109, 123, 126, 138, 142 [14]: 36–41 The main gates of Fes Jdid include Bab Dekkakin, Bab Semmarine, and Bab al-Amer.[52] In modern times, the function of gates became more ceremonial rather than defensive, as reflected by the 1913 construction of the decorative Bab Bou Jeloud gate at the western entrance of Fes el-Bali by the French colonial administration.[14]: 42Several forts were constructed along the defensive perimeters of the medina during different time periods. A "kasbah" in the context of Maghrebi region is the traditional military structure for fortification, military preparation, command and control. Some of them were occupied as well by citizens, certain tribal groups, and merchants. Throughout the city's history, 13 kasbahs were constructed.[150] Among them is the Kasbah an-Nouar, the Kasbah Tamdert, and the Kasbah Cherarda.[14]: 36–37 [13]: 105–108 The Saadis also built a number of bastions and forts in the late 16th century including Borj Nord and its sister fort, Borj Sud.[151][13]: 84, 105Since the city's foundation, the tanning industry has been continually operating in Fez and is considered one of the main tourist attractions. There are three tanneries in the city, largest among them is Chouara Tannery near the Saffarin Madrasa along the river. The tanneries are packed with the round stone wells filled with dye or white liquids for softening the hides. The leather goods produced in the tanneries are exported around the world.[152][153][154] The two other major tanneries are the Sidi Moussa Tannery to the west of the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Ain Azliten Tannery in the neighbourhood of the same name on the northern edge of Fes el-Bali.[13]: 220Many old private residences have also survived to this day, in various states of conservation. The typical traditional house (dar) is centered around an internal courtyard. Some of these houses also had internal gardens known as a riad.[155]: 55–75 [13]: 495–496 Such private houses include the Dar al-Alami,[156] the Dar Saada (now a restaurant), Dar 'Adiyil, Dar Belghazi, and others. Larger and richer mansions, such as the Dar Mnebhi, Dar Moqri, and Jamai Palace, have also been preserved.[14]: 103–156 Numerous traditional houses, popularly known as "riads", are now utilized as hotels for the tourism industry.[157] The Jamai Palace was converted into a luxury hotel, known as Palais Jamaï, in the early 20th century.[158][14]: 116 The lavish former mansion of the Glaoui clan, known as the Dar Glaoui, is partly open to visitors but still privately owned.[159]As a former capital, the city contains several royal palaces as well. Dar Batha is a former palace completed by the 'Alawi Sultan Abdelaziz. In 1915 it was turned into a museum of historical art and artifacts, containing around 6,000 pieces.[160] A large area of Fes Jdid is also taken up by the 80-hectare Royal Palace, or Dar al-Makhzen. Its ornate gates built in 1969–71 are the main feature visible to the public. Its grounds are not open to the public, as they are still used by the King of Morocco when visiting the city.[161]: 148 [82]The Jnan Sbil Garden, between Fes Jdid and Fes el-Bali, is the oldest surviving garden in Fez and was created as a royal park and garden in the 19th century by Sultan Moulay Hassan I.[14]: 296 [13]: 100 [162] Many bourgeois and aristocratic mansions also had private gardens, especially in the southwestern part of Fes el-Bali.[13]: 124, 482 Other gardens also exist within the grounds of the historic royal palaces of the city, such as the Agdal and Lalla Mina Gardens in the Royal Palace or the gardens of the Dar el-Beida (originally attached to Dar Batha).[13]: 90, 97 [14]: 154, 294–296 [161]: 150The old city of Fez includes more than a hundred funduqs or foundouks (traditional inns, or urban caravanserais). These commercial buildings housed the workshops of artisans or provided lodging for merchants and travelers.[13]: 318 They also frequently served as venues for other commercial activities such as markets and auctions.[13]: 190–191, 280, 307–308 The Funduq al-Najjarin was built in the 18th century by Amin Adiyil to provide accommodation and storage for merchants and now houses the Nejjarine Museum of Wooden Arts & Crafts.[163][13]: 134 Other major important examples include the Funduq Shamma'in (also spelled Foundouk Chemmaïne) and the Funduq Staouniyyin (or Funduq of the Tetouanis), both dating from the Marinid era or earlier, and the Funduq Sagha which is contemporary with the Funduq al-Najjariyyin.[13][38][164][165][166]Fez has preserved many of its historic hammams (public bathhouses in the Muslim world) which continue to be used by local people.[168][169][170] Examples, all dating from around the 14th century, include the Hammam as-Saffarin, the Hammam al-Mokhfiya, and the Hammam Ben Abbad.[171][168][169] They were generally built next to a well or natural spring which provided water, while the sloping topography of the city allowed for easy drainage.[168] The layout of the traditional hammam in the region was inherited from the Roman bathhouse model, consisting of a changing room, a cold room, a warm room, and a hot room.[168][169] Though their architecture can be very functional, some of them, like the Hammam as-Saffarin and the Hammam al-Mokhfiya, feature more decoration. The hammams are identifiable from the exterior by the domes and vaults above their main chambers.[168]The Ville Nouvelle is centered around Avenue Hassan II, a wide street laid out by the French colonial administration after 1912 and known then as Avenue de France.[172]: 139 A tree-lined park area runs along its middle between the lanes for car traffic. At the avenue's northeastern end is Place de la Résistance (originally called Place Gambetta), a large roundabout with a fountain at its center.[173][174]: 82 Further south along the same avenue is Place Florence (originally Place Lyautey), a wide plaza planted with trees and originally designed as a public garden.[175][176][174]: 82 At the southwest end of the avenue is Place Ahmed El Mansour (originally Place Galliéni).[174]: 82During the colonial period the main public buildings of the city were erected along and around this main avenue.[172]: 139 Buildings from this period were constructed in a mix of mauresque (neo-Moorish or Moroccan), Art Deco, and Neoclassical styles.[172]: 172–192 On the south side of Place Florence is the Bank al-Maghrib building, built between 1928 and 1931 by architect René Canu.[172]: 181 Nearby, on the east side of Avenue Hassan II, is the Central Post Office building. The first post office here was built in 1925 and 1927 by architect Edmond Pauty, but it was rebuilt and expanded in its current form by architect Emile Toulon in 1946–1947.[172]: 433 The Court of Appeals building, located southwest of the post office, was constructed in 1934–1936 by architects Adrien Laforgue and Antoine Marchisio and it originally housed the Court of First Instance (Tribunal de première instance).[172]: 181Fez is considered the spiritual and cultural heart of Morocco.[73][177][4]: 17–18 It is often called the "Mecca of the West" and the "Athens of Africa."[178][179][180]Up until the 19th century, the al-Qarawiyyin dominated the intellectual life of the city and of the country around it. Literature was focused on religious scholarship, philosophy, and poetry.[13]: 475–476 The city's largest library was located at the Qarawiyyin Mosque, while others were attached to other major mosques. Under Sultan Abd al-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) a new library was created inside the Royal Palace and later in the 19th century the city's wealthy elites began creating their own privates libraries.[13]: 472–473The city is also one of the historical centers of Moroccan Sufism and a significant body of written works were devoted to its many Sufi walis ("saints" or teachers). This type of literature established itself as one of the main literary genres of Morocco by the late 14th century and Sufi written works from Fez are especially abundant from the 17th to 20th centuries.[183]: 54, 108 A study by Ruggero Vimercati Sanseverino describes the rise of the Zawiya al-Fasiyya, a Sufi order founded in 1581 by Abu l-Mahasin Yusuf al-Fasi, as the impetus for the development of a tradition of Sufi literature particular to Fez.[183]: 109, 297 This literature was a diverse mix of hagiographies (religious biographies), genealogies, and historiographies whose conventions evolved over time. Writers sought to establish a continuity between the teachings of contemporary Sufi masters and those that came before them, with the city of Fez portrayed as the center of this spiritual heritage.[183]Towards the beginning of the 20th century Moroccan literature began to diversify, with polemic or political works becoming more common at this time. For example, there were Muhammad Bin Abdul-Kabir Al-Kattani's anti-colonial periodical at-Tā'ūn (الطاعون The Plague), and his uncle Muhammad ibn Jaqfar al-Kattani's popular Nasihat ahl al-Islam ("Advice to the People of Islam"), published in Fez in 1908, both of which called on Moroccans to unite against European encroachment.[54]: 68, 86Fez, along with Cordoba, was one of the centers of a Jewish intellectual and cultural renaissance that took place in the 10th and 11th centuries in Morocco and al-Andalus.[42][44] Jewish literary figures associated with Fez include the poet Dunash Ben Labrat (d. c. 990), the grammarian Judah ben David Hayyuj (d. c. 1012), the Talmudist Isaac al-Fasi (d. 1103), and the scholar Joseph ben Judah ibn Aknin (d. c. 1220), who were all born in Fez or spent time there.[44][185] Maimonides (d. 1204), one of the most important Jewish intellectuals of his era, also lived in Fez from 1159 to 1165 after fleeing al-Andalus.[42] The first book printed on the African continent was printed in Fez. A copy of Sefer Abudarham (ספר אבודרהם) was printed in Hebrew in 1516 by Samuel ben Isaac Nedivot and his son, who were Jewish refugees from Lisbon.[186][187] The press was short-lived and printed 15 copies, one of which is now preserved at the Library of Congress.[188][189][99]: 99Printing in Arabic was introduced to Morocco in 1864–65, on the initiative of a man named Muhammad at-Tayyib ar-Rudani [ar], an Islamic scholar and judge originally from the Sous region. In 1864 Ar-Rudani, while returning from his Hajj pilgrimage, bought an Arabic printing press in Cairo and contracted an Egyptian operator, bringing both back with him to Morocco. The press appears to have been confiscated by the Moroccan authorities when it arrived at port and sent to Meknes, where Sultan Muhammad IV was residing at the time. The first book in Arabic was thus printed in Meknes in June 1865, before the press was moved again to Fez in that same year, where it continued to operate until the 1940s.[99]: 110–115 The press was installed in a central neighbourhood of Fes el-Bali and was managed by the government, which printed traditional scholarly books and made some of the productions available to the Qarawiyyin University free of charge. After 1871 the government transferred management of the press to private citizens and the applications of printing widened.[99]: 119–128, 140 After 1897 it became a regulated industry overseen by officials in Fez.[99]: 134–139 By 1908 there were at least four printing establishments in Fez, while two other Moroccan printers were in Tangier.[99]: 139 Hebrew printing presses were reintroduced to Morocco in the 1890s in Tangier and were more firmly established across the country in the 1920s.[190][189]Maghrebi Arabic script is an important part of the history of visual art in Fes.[192] While some aspects of Maghrebi script are codified and prescribed, there have also been innovations, such as those by the 19th century calligrapher Muhammad al-Qandusi.[193]Fez remains the most important production center in Morocco for the art of zellij (traditional mosaic tilework) .[194][195] Zellij workshops in other cities, such as Meknes, Salé and Marrakesh, usually follow or emulate the craftsmanship style of Fez.[195]The modernist artist Jilali Gharbaoui studied at the Académie des Arts in Fes.[196]Joseph Bouhsira was one of the earliest Moroccan photographers.[197]Fes is associated with the tarab al-āla [ar] (Arabic: طرب الآلة, lit. 'joy of the instrument') musical style, a result of a large migration of Muslims from Valencia to Fes.[198] The Fessi āla style utilizes the Moroccan forms of the Andalusi nubah melodical arrangements.[199] While this musical style is sometimes popularly referred to as Andalusi music, those who have studied it reject this naming: Mohamed El Fassi intentionally chose the name āla (Arabic: آلة, lit. 'instrument') to differentiate it from the Sufi tradition of samā, which is purely vocal, while Idrīs Bin Jellūn at-Twīmī [fr], in his study of Mohammed al-Haik's Kunash al-Haik (Arabic: كناش الحائك), described the appellation "Andalusi music" as an unprecedented colonial invention "meant to detract from [the musical form's] Arabness and [Moroccans'] intellectual and artistic abilities."[200]The city's main museums are housed in historic monuments mentioned above, including the Nejjarine Museum, the Dar Batha Museum, and the Arms Museum in Borj Nord.[82][201] The Al Houria Cultural Complex, opened in 2005, is a cultural center in the Ville Nouvelle that includes a theatre, a media library, and exhibition spaces.[202][203][204] Several language institutes in Fez also organize cultural activities in addition to offering courses. The French Institute and the Cervantes Institute have branches in Fez which promote French and Spanish, respectively.[205][206] The American Language Center and the Arabic Language Institute in Fez, sister organizations that share the same location in the Ville Nouvelle, offer courses in English and Arabic, respectively.[207][208][209]Fez hosts the annual World Sacred Music Festival, which started in 1994 and showcases religious music from around the world. The festival occurs in May or June and concerts take place at multiple venues across the city, including at historic sites such as Bab Makina (the New Mechouar) in Fes Jdid.[210][211] The annual Festival of Amazigh Culture, which started in 2005, normally takes place in July and hosts performances from Amazigh (Berber) musicians and artists from across Morocco.[212][213][214] The annual Festival of Sufi Culture hosts a conference with discussions and debates on Sufism as well as Sufi musical performances and rituals such as haḍras.[215][216] The Festival of Malhoun Art features performances of malhun music and poetry from across the country.[217][218]Multiple moussems (Sufi religious festivals) have traditionally taken place every year in honour of local Muslim saints and are typically sponsored by one or more of the city's guilds. The most important moussem in the city, and one of the most important in Morocco, is the Moussem of Moulay Idris II. This festival has taken place for hundreds of years[e] and is sponsored by all the guilds in the city, who march through the city together in a procession that culminates at the mausoleum of Idris II. Each guild donates gifts to the zawiya, one of which is a keswa, a large textile decorated with Qur'anic verses that is draped over Idris II's catafalque. The week of the moussem is also marked by other cultural events and entertainment.[219][4]: 86, 130 [220][221][13]: 301–302The Fez Running Festival is race that has taken place annually since 2022 with two competitions, one for kids and one for adults. It is organized by Abderrahime Bouramdane, a professional marathon runner who was born and raised in Fez. The festival sees thousands of participants every year who run a course that goes throughout the city.[222][223]Fez has two football teams, MAS Fez (Fés Maghrebi)[224] and Wydad de Fès (WAF).[225] They both play in the Botola the highest tier of the Moroccan football system and play their home matches at the 45,000 seat Complexe Sportif de Fès stadium.[226]Fez is one of the cities expected to host matches during the 2030 FIFA World Cup and there are plans to upgrade its sports stadium before this date.[227] It is also expected to host matches during the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.[228]The MAS Fez basketball team competes in the Nationale 1, Morocco's top basketball division.[229][230]The availability of green spaces in Fez is limited and significantly deviates from the international standard, which calls for a minimum of ten square meters of green space per resident. As of 2022, the city provides only two square meters of green space per resident.[231][232]Latin American Park is a park opened in the summer of 2015 that sits in the middle of Fez. It is around 3,700 square metres in area and employs about 40 workers. The park is dedicated to the relations of Fez and Latin America; its inauguration ceremony was attended by a delegation of ambassadors from Venezuela, Paraguay, and Panama. Latin American Park includes a number of facilities, such as a pool, a children's pavilion, cafes, and several trails.[233]The Bird Park or Tropicana Park is another green area in Fez. Over seven acres in size, it features playgrounds, community event spaces, restaurants, and rest areas. The park was opened in June 2014 and is credited with significantly improving the recreational infrastructure of Fez. Inside the park is a "Bird Garden" which hosts more than thirty species of birds, local and imported, such as peacocks, parrots, and the North African ostrich. There are also ponds with geese and ducks.[234]The city is served by the region's main international airport, Fès–Saïs, located roughly 15 km south of the city center.[82] A new terminal was added to the airport in 2017 which expanded the airport's capacity to 2.5 million visitors a year.[235]The city's main train station, operated by ONCF, is located a short distance from the downtown area of the Ville Nouvelle and is connected to the rail lines running east to Oujda and west to Tangier and Casablanca.[236][82] The main intercity bus terminal (or gare routière) is located just north of Bab Mahrouk, on the outskirts of the old medina, although CTM also operates a terminal off Boulevard Mohammed V in the Ville Nouvelle. Intercity taxis (also known as grands taxis) depart from and arrive at several spots including the Bab Mahrouk bus station (for western destinations like Meknes and Rabat), Bab Ftouh (for eastern destinations like Sidi Harazem and Taza), and another lot in the Ville Nouvelle (for southern destinations like Sefrou).[82][237]The city operates a public transit system with various bus routes.[238]The city's water supply, sewage, and electricity networks are managed by the Régie de distribution d'eau et d'électricité de Fès (lit. transl. Water and Electricity Distribution Authority of Fez). An activated sludge treatment plant has been treating Fez's wastewater since 2014.[239]Primary and secondary education in Fez is administered by Morocco's Ministry of National Education. It includes a preschool level, six years of primary school, followed by three years of middle school and three years of secondary school. Primary education, beginning at age six, is both free and obligatory. Vocational education is also offered.[240]Fez's University of al-Qarawiyyin is considered by some to be the oldest continually-operating university in the world.[241][73] The university was first founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 859 which subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the historic Muslim world.[71] It became a state university in 1963, and remains an important institution of learning today.[242]Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University is a public university founded in 1975 and is the largest in the city by attendance, counting over 86,000 students in 2020.[72][243][244] It has 12 faculties with sites across Fez; the two main campuses are known as Dhar El Mehraz and Sais.[243] Euro-Med University of Fez [ar], another public university, was created in 2012 and is certified by the Union for the Mediterranean.[245][246]The École polytechnique de Technologie was started in 2006 and quickly established itself as one of the leading institutions in the private higher education sector in the city of Fez. In 2013, it became the Private University of Fez [ar], the city's first private university.[247] Its main focus is its engineering school,[248] though it also offers diplomas in architecture, business, and law.[249]Fez is twinned with:[250]--- Content from  ---The World Heritage Centre is at the forefront of the international community’s efforts to protect and preserve.World Heritage partnerships for conservationEnsuring that World Heritage sites sustain their outstanding universal value is an increasingly challenging mission in today’s complex world, where sites are vulnerable to the effects of uncontrolled urban development, unsustainable tourism practices, neglect, natural calamities, pollution, political instability, and conflict.Our Partners DonateTake advantage of the search to browse through the World Heritage Centre information.Founded in the 9th century, Fez reached its height in the 13th–14th centuries under the Marinids, when it replaced Marrakesh as the capital of the kingdom. The urban fabric and the principal monuments in the medina – madrasas, fondouks, palaces, residences, mosques and fountains - date from this period. Although the political capital of Morocco was transferred to Rabat in 1912, Fez has retained its status as the country's cultural and spiritual centre.Description is available under license CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0Fondée au IXe siècle, Fès a connu sa période faste aux XIIIe et XIVe siècles, sous la dynastie mérinide, quand elle supplanta Marrakech comme capitale du royaume.

The original town was comprised of two large fortified quarters separated by the Fez wadi: the banks of the Andalous and those of the Kaïrouanais. In the 11th century, the Almoravids reunited the town within a sole rampart and, under the dynasty of the Almohads (12th and 13th centuries), the original town (Fez el-bali) already grew to its present-day size. Under the Merinids (13th to 15th centuries), a new town (Fez Jedid) was founded (in 1276) to the west of the ancient one (Fez El-Bali). It contains the royal palace, the army headquarters, fortifications and residential areas. At that time, the two entities of the Medina of Fez evolve in symbiosis forming one of the largest Islamic metropolis's representing a great variety of architectural forms and urban landscapes. They include a considerable number of religious, civil and military monuments that brought about a multi-cultural society. This architecture is characterised by construction techniques and decoration developed over a period of more than ten centuries, and where local knowledge and skills are interwoven with diverse outside inspiration (Andalousian, Oriental and African). The Medina of Fez is considered as one of the most extensive and best conserved historic towns of the Arab-Muslim world. The unpaved urban space conserves the majority of its original functions and attribute. It not only represents an outstanding architectural, archaeological and urban heritage, but also transmits a life style, skills and a culture that persist and are renewed despite the diverse effects of the evolving modern societies.Criterion (ii): The Medina of Fez bears a living witness to a flourishing city of the eastern Mediterranean having exercised considerable influence mainly from the 12th to the 15th centuries, on the development of architecture, monumental arts and town-planning, notably in North Africa, Andalousia and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fez Jedid (the new town), was inspired from the earlier town-planning model of Marrakesh.Criterion (v): The Medina of Fez constitutes an outstanding example of a medieval town created during the very first centuries of Islamisation of Morocco and presenting an original type of human settlement and traditional occupation of the land representative of Moroccan urban culture over a long historical period (from the 9th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). The ancient fragmented district of the medina with its high density of monuments of religious, civil and military character, are outstanding examples of this culture and the resulting interaction with the diverse stratas of the population that have influenced the wide variety of architectural forms and urban landscapes.Integrity (2009)The boundaries of the property inscribed on the World Heritage List are clear and appropriate and include the urban fabric and the walls. The buffer zone defined by the Decrees of 23 August 1923 and 29 October 1954 adequately protects the visual integrity. The Medina of Fez comprises an urban fabric that has remained remarkably homogenous and intact over the centuries. The main problems noted are the deterioration of the buildings and the over-populated area. The surrounds of the medina are an indispensable element of the visual aspect of its environment and must be maintained as a non-constructible zone. This area is vulnerable due to pressure from uncontrolled urban development.Authenticity (2009)All the key elements that comprise the property reflect in a clear and integral manner the Outstanding Universal Value. The survival of traditional architectural know-how, notably as regards architectural building and decoration trades, is a major advantage for the maintenance of the values of the property. The Ministry for Culture endeavours, not without difficulty, to ensure that the different actors respect the authenticity of the property.Protection and management requirements (2009)The Medina of Fez is protected by the local and national legal texts for its preservation and reinforcement, at the local level, of its inscription of the World Heritage List, and notably Decree N°2-81-25 of 22 October 1981 for the enforcement of Law N°22-80 concerning the conservation of historic monuments and sites, inscriptions and art objects and antiquity.Given the vulnerability of the property, the State adopted a Development Plan of the Medina in 2001. This plan is re-evaluated every ten years. It incorporates specific provisions for the ancient district, and it should rationalise and organize the required urban interventions. In the framework of the programme for the promotion of regional tourism, the local authorities have undertaken safeguarding actions concerning houses threatened with collapse and the rehabilitation of the remarkable monuments of the Medina. The implementation of this programme has been entrusted to the Agency for De-densification and Rehabilitation of the Medina of Fez. The Inspection of the Historic Monuments is the responsibility of the Ministry for Culture and thus ensures the monitoring and the supervision of these projects in conformity with national and international standards for the conservation of historic monuments.The Nomination files produced by the States Parties are published by the World Heritage Centre at its website and/or in working documents in order to ensure transparency, access to information and to facilitate the preparations of comparative analysis by other nominating States Parties.The sole responsibility for the content of each Nomination file lies with the State Party concerned.

Faisant partie des villes impériales du Maroc, elle a été à plusieurs époques la capitale du pays et est considérée de nos jours comme sa capitale spirituelle[4].Sa fondation remonte à la fin du VIIIe siècle, sous le règne du sultan Moulay Idriss Ier. Son prestige passé en a fait l'un des foyers majeurs[5] de la civilisation islamique relié à Baghdad, Damas, Cordoue, Le Caire, Kairouan, Grenade, Palerme, Ispahan et Samarcande, avec lesquels elle avait établi des échanges aussi bien économiques[6] que sociaux et culturels[7],[8].Divers titres ont été attribués à la ville de Fès, dont l'Athènes de l'Afrique, la reine du Maghreb et la Bagdad du Maghreb[9].Elle s'étend sur trois secteurs: la ville ancienne (médina), classée au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO[10], l'enceinte royale et les quartiers nouveaux, établis par les Français, et qui s'étendent de nos jours dans la plaine environnante.Sur le plan administratif, la ville est composée de la commune de Fès, qui est divisée en six arrondissements, et de la municipalité de Méchouar Fès Jdid, où se trouve le palais royal. Fès est la deuxième ville du Maroc avec une population de 1 150 131 habitants selon le recensement de 2015.L'origine du toponyme Fès est incertaine ; plusieurs étymologies existent, certaines issues de la légende populaire, d'autres de travaux d'historiens.Connue depuis au moins le Xe siècle, l'étymologie classique de Fès, telle que rapportée par les auteurs anciens (Abou Bakr ben Mohammed er-Razi et Ibn Abi Zar), explique le nom de Fès par la découverte, lors du creusement des fondations de la ville en construction, d'une pioche, en arabe فأس (Fä's), qui donnera le nom de Madinat Fäs[11]. Une autre version, rapportée par El-Modaffari, décrit la pioche découverte comme très ancienne, de grande taille (quatre empans de long sur un de large) et pesant soixante livres[12].Selon une autre étymologie issue de la légende populaire, Idris Ier, fondateur de Fès, participa à la construction de la ville et aida au creusement des fondations au moyen d'une pioche d'or et d'argent, et c'est ainsi que la ville prit le nom arabe de la pioche (fès)[12].Une autre hypothèse étymologique lie l'origine du nom à une métathèse. Deux versions sont proposées. La première, rapportée par Ibn Abi Zar dans son Rawd al-Qirtas, parle d'un vieux moine chrétien qui aurait révélé à Idris Ier l'existence, à l'emplacement où sera construite Fès, d'une ancienne ville nommée Saf ou Sèf, fondée par les Anciens et disparue mille à mille sept cents ans auparavant ; la métathèse Saf en Fès expliquerait le nom de la ville[11],[12]. Idris Ier aurait lui-même décidé de la métathèse Séf en Fès[12]. Une autre version — avancée à l'origine par Larbi Mezzine — ancien doyen de la faculté de lettres à l'université de Kenitra et maître en toponymie berbère —, suggère une origine berbère au nom de la ville. Les cours d'eau étant nombreux autour de la ville (Wad Fäs, Wad Zhun, Wad Zitun, etc.), le nom de Fès serait une métathèse d'isaffen (pluriel d'asif, rivière en berbère)[11]Voici encore une autre proposition d'étymologie : en langue Amazigh : ⴼⴰⵙ, Fas) ou Afas qui veut dire sol ou terre qui se compacte; car la ville Afas est construite sur les marnes bleues d'âge Miocène supérieur, et qui se compactent lors des pluies alternant avec les périodes de sécheresse.[réf. souhaitée]La ville « Médina Fès » a été fondée[13] par le chérif alide Idris Ier en 789 à l'emplacement de l'actuel quartier des Andalous. En 808, le régent Rashid Ben Morshid fonde « al-Aliya » sur l'autre rive de l'oued de Fès. Al Aliya se développe très vite et devient une véritable ville avec mosquée, palais et kissariya (halle, marché).Les sources d'eau vitales aux alentours de la ville de Fès, qui avant même sa fondation étaient connues et louées en chanson, ont sans aucun doute été un critère important lors du choix de l'emplacement pour la future métropole.Les évolutions suivantes sont dues à deux vagues successives d'émigration : à partir de 817–818 s'installent dans la ville fondée par Idrîs Ier près de 800 familles andalouses expulsées par les Omeyyades des faubourgs de Cordoue. Peu de temps après, environ 200 familles de Kairouan en Ifriqiya s'installent sur la rive d'al-Aliya. La mosquée universitaire Quaraouiyine fondée par l'aristocrate kairouanaise Fatima el Fihriya au IXe siècle devient l'un des centres spirituels et culturels les plus importants de l'époque et participe à l'âge d'or intellectuel de la civilisation islamique. Son influence se fait ressentir jusque dans les écoles d'Al-Andalus, et au-delà vers l'Europe d'où elle attire un grand nombre de savants et de mystiques.Les nouveaux arrivants apportent avec eux aussi bien un savoir-faire technique et artisanal qu'une longue expérience de la vie citadine. Sous leur impulsion, Fès devient un centre culturel important.Fès se trouve à un emplacement particulièrement avantageux, au croisement de routes commerciales importantes, au cœur d'une région naturellement généreuse avec des matières premières précieuses pour l'artisanat (pierre, bois, argile). Ceci lui permet de développer une riche culture esthétique issue de la grande tradition de l'art arabo-andalou. Fès se trouve sur la route des caravanes allant de la Méditerranée à l'Afrique subsaharienne en passant par la grande cité commerciale de Sijilmassa (disparue au XVIIe siècle) dans la région de Tafilalet, ce qui augmente également son attrait économique.Aux Xe et XIe siècles, la ville de Fès est prise par les Maghraoua. Elle sera le théâtre de bataille entre les tribus Zénètes Maghraoua et Banou Ifren faisant successivement allégeance au califat de Cordoue ou aux Fatimides[14].C'est dans cette période qu'advint un massacre contre la communauté juive faisant 6 000 victimes dans ce qu'on appela le Massacre de Fès de 1033[15]. Sous le règne des Almoravides puis sous celui des Almohades la ville abrite une communauté chrétienne mozarabe originaire d'Al-Andalus[16]. Des traditions rapportées par Ibn Khaldoun et par le Rawd al-Qirtas font mention de l'existence d'un temple du feu en un lieu nommé Chibouba, à l'emplacement de Madinat Fas, ce qui attesterait de la présence théorique d'adeptes du zoroastrisme[17],[18].Les deux parties de la ville s'unissent au Moyen Âge en 1069, détruisant le mur qui les séparait. Fès perd son rôle de capitale avec la fondation de Marrakech et la prise de Tlemcen par la dynastie almoravide au XIe siècle mais le reprend en 1250 grâce à la dynastie mérinide. Sous leur règne, la nouvelle ville El Medinet El-Beida (la ville blanche) est fondée en 1276 ; elle est équipée de remparts, de palais et de jardins. Elle est rapidement connue sous le nom de Fès Jedid (la nouvelle Fès) en opposition à Fès el Bali (la vieille ville). La population juive qui se trouvait aux alentours du palais est forcée de partir et le Mellah (quartier juif) se forme dans l'ancien quartier de la garnison des archers syriens.Au début du XIVe siècle (apogée de l'art hispano-mauresque), la ville connaît une forte croissance. Grâce aux caravanes allant jusqu'au port de Badis dans le Rif, Fès est en permanence liée au royaume de Grenade et à l'ensemble du monde méditerranéen. Lors de la révolte marocaine de 1465, la communauté juive locale est de nouveau décimée. En 1471, la ville tombe aux mains de la dynastie Beni Ouattas qui ne règne que sur le royaume de Fès dans la portion nord du Maroc actuel. Après la prise de Grenade par les rois catholiques d'Espagne en 1492, Boabdil le dernier sultan de la dynastie des Nasrides se réfugie à Fès avec toute sa suite. Il y décède vers 1533, et serait inhumé possiblement au mausolée dit de Msalla al Soltane[19],[20].En 1522, Fès souffre d'un séisme qui détruit la ville en partie. Dans les années qui suivent, de nombreux bâtiments sont reconstruits, restaurés ou remplacés. La dynastie chérifienne des Saadiens prend en 1554 la ville qu'elle dispute à la régence d'Alger, qui s'en empare une nouvelle fois en 1576 grâce à une armée de 10 000 hommes dont 6 000 janissaires sous les ordres de Ramdan Pacha[21],[22]; mais les souverains saadiens choisissent Marrakech comme capitale. Le sultan ottoman Mourad III, qui avait aidé le prétendant saadien Moulay Abdelmalik Saadi à conquérir le trône marocain, espérait incorporer la partie du Maroc correspondant au royaume de Fès à l'Empire ottoman, mais son stratagème sera déjoué par Ahmed al-Mansour après la bataille des Trois Rois remportée contre les Portugais en 1578 (voir Conflits maroco-ottomans)[23]. Al-Mansour fait nommer à Fès un khalifa représentant du sultan de Marrakech, et fait édifier des bordjs en vue de protéger la ville d'une éventuelle nouvelle menace ottomane[24]. À la suite du déclin de la dynastie saadienne, Fès tombe sous la domination de la zaouïa de Dila au milieu du XVIIe siècle.C'est à Fès que Moulay Rachid se fait proclamer sultan de l'Empire chérifien en 1667, devenant ainsi le premier souverain de la dynastie alaouite, mais son successeur Moulay Ismail désigne Meknès comme nouvelle capitale du Maroc à partir de 1672. Il installe à Fès en garnison une partie de la tribu Guich des Oudayas qui l'avait aidé à gagner le pouvoir. Après sa mort (1727), les Oudayas se mutinent, et ils ne seront expulsés de la ville qu'en 1833 par le sultan Abd al-Rahman. Moulay Abdallah, le successeur de Moulay Ismail, fait de Fès son lieu de résidence permanent pendant la guerre dynastique alaouite et fait rénover ou construire mosquées, écoles (madrasas), ponts et rues, notamment les rues de Fès Jedid qui sont désormais pavées. Mohammed III s'installe en revanche à Marrakech entre 1757 et 1790. En 1820 Fès se révolte contre le sultan Moulay Slimane, et ce soulèvement mené de concert avec les Aït Oumalou et autres tribus importantes du Moyen Atlas conduit à l'ascension sociale de la puissante bourgeoisie marchande au détriment de l'élite religieuse traditionnelle[25]. Le makhzen ayant perdu le contrôle de la capitale de l'Empire chérifien, Moulay Slimane discrédité par sa politique se voit obligé d'abdiquer en 1822 en faveur de son neveu Abd al-Rahman.Au XIXe siècle, les deux anciennes parties de la ville sont reliées. Jusqu'au début du protectorat en 1912, Fès est la capitale du Maroc, fonction qui est par la suite dévolue à Rabat[26]. Les explorateurs Charles de Foucauld et Mardochée Aby Serour séjournent à Fès lors du ramadan 1883 car ils ne parviennent pas à trouver de protecteurs pour poursuivre leur route vers le sud. Ils logent dans le mellah chez M. Benchimol, une inscription sur la maison signale encore leur passage. Foucauld décrit le commerce florissant de la ville entre les marchandises européennes en provenance de Tanger, " les cuirs du Tafilalet, les laines, la cire et les peaux de chèvres des Aït Ioussi et des Beni Ouaraïn, parfois même les plumes du Soudan"[27]. Mais pour l'explorateur le potentiel commercial de la ville pourrait être valorisé. Trois raisons entravent son développement selon lui; l'insécurité permanente des routes marocaines en raison des guerres et des pillages que se livrent les tribus, le prix élevé des transports à cause des péages et du coût des escortes, enfin le taux de crédit excessivement élevé dont il fait une analyse détaillée.En plus d'une description de la situation économique et politique de la capitale marocaine, l'explorateur français offre un témoignage sur les costumes et la mode fassie à la fin du XIXe siècle. Il loue par ailleurs "la grande beauté" et la "propreté merveilleuse" des habitants[27].C'est à Fès que le traité franco-marocain instaurant le Protectorat français au Maroc est signé le 30 mars 1912. La promotion de Saint-Cyr de 1909-1912 porte le nom de « Promotion de Fez ». Moins de trois semaines après la proclamation officielle du Protectorat, d'importantes émeutes antifrançaises éclatent dans la ville et font des centaines de victimes : rebelles, civils musulmans et Juifs, Européens. Les autorités du Protectorat déplacent alors la capitale à Rabat, mais Fès reste cependant un important lieu de résidence royale et un centre culturel, politique et économique de premier ordre.Une ville nouvelle est créée sur les plans d'Henri Prost, à côté de la médina qui fait, quant à elle, l'objet d'une politique patrimoniale avant-gardiste. Beaucoup d'initiatives nationalistes et anticolonialistes ont Fès pour origine, ce qui fait de la ville un berceau majeur du mouvement national marocain et notamment du parti de l'Istiqlal.En 1944, est rédigé le Manifeste pour l'Indépendance dans une maison de l'ancienne médina, située aujourd'hui Place de l'Istiqlal. La ville connaît néanmoins des difficultés sociales croissantes après 1956, et doit faire face au déferlement de l'exode rural. Les émeutes de 1990 sont le point culminant de cette détérioration des conditions de vie.Sous la direction de Lyautey et d'après les plans de l'architecte Henri Prost, une nouvelle ville se développe dans les environs de Dar Debibagh au sud de Fès Jedid. Si elle fut dans un premier temps le quartier résidentiel des Européens, la « ville nouvelle » a continué à se développer comme ville arabe moderne avec de nouveaux quartiers de villas. Les autorités, institutions et entreprises de services s'y sont installées.Une des conséquences du transfert de la capitale sur le littoral atlantique est le départ d'une grande partie de la population fassie de souche vers Casablanca, Rabat et dans une moindre mesure Tanger. Du simple artisan à l'entrepreneur en passant par le lettré beaucoup furent obligés de quitter une ville qui avait perdu son statut prestigieux.La ville de Fès compte 1 112 072 habitants en 2014[28]. Elle se divise en trois parties :Fès el-Jedid et Fès el-Bali forment la médina de Fès, faisant partie du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.La Médina de Fès abrite actuellement[Quand ?] une population de 156 000 habitants[29] et s'étend sur 271 hectares[30].Les habitants de Fès sont appelés « Fassis ». À noter toutefois que ce terme désigne également au Maroc une population plus large, celle des descendants des familles anciennes de Fès ayant quitté la ville au cours du XXe siècle pour s'installer vers l'axe Casablanca-Rabat.La commune de Fès se compose de 6 arrondissements locaux :Depuis les élections de 2021, le maire de Fès est Abdeslam Bekkali (عبد السلام البقالي).L'altitude de Fès est d'environ 400 m. L'océan Atlantique se situe à 160 km à l'ouest à vol d'oiseau, Rabat à 200 km.La ville, située dans la plaine du Saïss, entre le Rif au nord et le Moyen Atlas au Sud, subit l'effet de versant des montagnes. La vieille ville est située dans une vallée le long des rives de l'Oued Fès juste au-dessus de sa confluence avec la plus grande rivière Sebou au nord-est. La rivière Fès prend ses sources du sud et à l'ouest et est divisé en plusieurs petits canaux qui alimentent la ville historique en eau. Ceux-ci se jettent à leur tour dans l’Oued Bou Khrareb, le tronçon de rivière qui traverse le milieu de Fès el-Bali et sépare le quartier Qarawiyyin du quartier andalou.Le climat de Fès est méditerranéen, mâtiné de continentalité et subissant les influences atlantiques. Il est comparable à celui des villes du sud de l'Espagne, Cordoue notamment.L'hiver est plutôt doux voire froid, et humide. En janvier, les minimales moyennes avoisinent les 4 °C, tandis que les maximales sont légèrement supérieures à 14 °C. Cela dit, des épisodes de gel ne sont pas rares (le mercure peut afficher 0 °C, voire un peu moins en décembre, janvier ou février). L'hiver 2004-2005 a été tout à fait exceptionnel : le mercure a, plusieurs fois, atteint la barre des -3/−4 °C, voire au-delà. Le 28 janvier 2005, à 10h du matin, il est même descendu à −8 °C (record absolu de la ville).Lorsque les masses d'air fraîches et humides, en provenance du nord-ouest, intéressent le Maroc, elles s'accompagnent d'une baisse sensible du mercure (pendant trois, quatre, voire cinq jours, il arrive que le mercure affiche 9 °C/10 °C au plus chaud de la journée), de vents froids et de pluies abondantes. Ces précipitations tombent sous forme de neige, dès 1 000 mètres. La fraîcheur hivernale rappelle souvent la neige du Moyen Atlas à 40 km au sud de la ville. Lorsque le mercure descend en dessous des −2 °C (phénomène assez récurrent : janvier 2013 (−3,0 °C) février 2012 (−4,3 °C), décembre 2011 (−2,4 °C), janvier 2010 (−2,7 °C), janvier 2009 (−2,5 °C), janvier 2007 (−3,0 °C), janvier 2006 (−4,0 °C), le massif du Kandar (Moyen-Atlas à 40 kilomètres au sud) est couvert d'un épais manteaux neigeux.On dit qu'il neige à Fès un an sur deux ou un an sur trois. (26 janvier 2007, 28 janvier 2006, 24 janvier 2005). Les précipitations annuelles sont comprises entre 500 et 700 mm.Le printemps est agréable. Des épisodes frais et pluvieux ne sont néanmoins pas à exclure, surtout en mars! Il neige encore fréquemment à Ifrane à 60 kilomètres au sud. Le mois de mai marque généralement une rupture assez nette. Le mercure y atteint souvent les 30/32 °C. Cela dit, des orages, accompagnés de fraîcheur, ne sont pas à exclure. Fin mai 2015, la ville était sujet des précipitations torrentielles cumulant 117,2 mm en une seule journée.Ces derniers se sont très rares dès le mois de juin. Le climat de la ville devient extrêmement sec de juin à septembre! Il est fréquent qu'il ne pleuve aucune goutte pendant 3 mois. L'été, les températures moyennes maximales montent jusqu'à 40 °C.En septembre, les minimales sont voisines de 19 °C, tandis que les maximales dépassent légèrement les 31 °C. Le mois de novembre marque une transition plutôt nette. C'est le mois le plus pluvieux de l'année! C'est aussi en novembre qu'il recommence à neiger dans l'Atlas voisin, à partir de 1 200 mètres. Les cimes dépassant les 2 000 mètres enregistrent leurs premières chutes de neige dès le mois d'octobre.[31]La ville de Fès a toujours été considérée comme la capitale culturelle et spirituelle du royaume du Maroc. Elle a abrité pendant longtemps la seule université de l'Afrique du Nord après l'université Zitouna de Tunis : l'université Al Quaraouiyine qui se distingue par sa grande bibliothèque portant le même nom. Actuellement[Quand ?] Fès demeure une destination culturelle par excellence. Dans le passé les étudiants venaient de loin pour faire des études de théologie (les medersa). Ils étaient groupés dans des sortes d'internats à proximité des medersa et recevaient une bourse symbolique.L'université Al Quaraouiyine à Fès est considérée comme la plus ancienne au monde par l’Unesco, le Guinness des records et des historiens musulmans. Encore en activité, sa construction a débuté en 859 sous le règne de la dynastie idrisside. Elle a vu passer de grands philosophes arabes comme Averroès (Ibn Rochd) et Avempace (Ibn Baja). Elle est l'emblème de la ville et son architecture est un des meilleurs représentant du style arabo-andalou (9). Son nom est issu de la communauté des 2 000 familles urbaines kairouanaises (de Kairouan) qui s'était installée et avait fondé le nouveau quartier dans la ville (voir plus haut).Fondée au IXe siècle, elle fut d'abord une école coranique dépendant d’une mosquée. À ce titre, elle peut postuler au titre de la plus ancienne université du monde[32],[33], ou en tout cas du plus vieil établissement d'enseignement. Cela, si toutefois l’on ne tient pas compte des écoles philosophiques fondées à Athènes au IVe siècle av. J.-C., comme l’Académie de Platon (-387), de la bibliothèque et du Musée d’Alexandrie (IIIe siècle av. J.-C.), et des nombreuses écoles supérieures qui s’en sont inspirées dans l’empire gréco-romain ; des écoles attenant aux grands monastères bouddhistes comme celui de Nālandā fondé au IIe siècle en Inde ; ou de l’ « université » de Gundishapur en Perse (IIIe siècle apr. J.-C.).Comme toutes les universités du Moyen Âge (Europe chrétienne ou Occident et Orient musulmans), elle a d'abord été théologique puis, comme la théologie définit le droit, juridique, elle a également joué un rôle de préservation et de diffusion de la langue arabe (linguistique, grammaire, rhétorique) et de traduction de textes (hébreu, grec, latin vers l'arabe). Elle est aussi une bibliothèque de manuscrits.Ce rôle juridique a aussi une fonction essentielle : par son rôle d'archives (héritage en particulier) elle a aussi eu une fonction de compilation et de point de référence des lignages familiaux. Or, ces derniers ont un rôle important dans l'affirmation des grandes familles de la ville. Elle a donc permis d'établir certains droits et titres.Sur les plans théologique et juridique, elle a été le point nodal de la doctrine malékite. Cette doctrine ou rite a aujourd'hui une extension importante : en gros toute l'Afrique de l'Ouest musulmane jusqu'aux pays Haoussa au Niger et Nigeria.Plusieurs figures de proue de cet enseignement sont à citer :Un apport important de l’université Al Quaraouiyine à la société marocaine et aux sociétés arabo-islamiques est l’édification de la personnalité islamique, de l’identité religieuse et de la mémoire sociale.L'université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah de Fès est une université moderne fondée en 1975. On y compte treize établissements en pleine relance dotés d'installations de qualité : bibliothèques, amphithéâtres, laboratoires, salles de conférences, équipement multimédia :Les établissements de l'Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah de Fès :Président : Radouane MrabetL'université Euro-Méditerranéenne de Fès (UEMF) est une université ultra-moderne et écologique fondée en novembre 2012. C'est une université à caractère régional qui a pour objectif de promouvoir les échanges, le dialogue interculturel et les partenariats académiques et culturels dans la région Euro-Méditerranéenne ainsi que la formation et la recherche de haut niveau. Son originalité réside dans sa forte dimension multinationale et pluridisciplinaire. En effet, les étudiants recrutés proviennent des différents pays membres du consortium EuroMed Tech (Maroc, France, Espagne, Italie et Portugal) dont elle fait partie, mais également d'Afrique du Nord et du Moyen-Orient. L'université veut répondre à la volonté de développement du Maroc.L'université est constituée de deux pôles : le pôle ingénierie et architecture et le pôle sciences humaines et sociales[34].La maison de la culture Agdal en centre-ville comporte une salle de théâtre et de concerts, des salles d'exposition et une bibliothèque. La Galerie Mohamed Kacimi, construite par l'État et gérée par la ville propose des expositions d'art contemporain. C'est aussi à Fès que l'atelier de production et de formation de L'appartement 22 est développé par Abdellah Karroum. Ces sessions ont donné lieu à des productions pour la radio culturelle R22.Si l'arabe classique reste la langue littéraire, l'arabe dialectal est ultra-majoritaire. Le parler de Fès présente cependant des tournures particulières que d'aucuns qualifieraient de précieuses, tendant à enjoliver/adoucir/féminiser les mots (kwiyyiss au lieu de ka's) issues de l'arabe andalou. Il est encore parlé par quelques dizaines de milliers de descendants des Familles anciennes de Fès. Parler non-hilalien proche des parlers de Meknès, de Rabat et de Tétouan, on y retrouve quelques emprunts lexicaux à la langue espagnole et des caractéristiques de l'arabe andalou.Il est à noter également que nombreux habitants des classes supérieures parlent le français en tant que première langue avant l'arabe[35].Fès fonde de grands espoirs sur le tourisme. L'infrastructure hôtelière a connu ces dernières années une croissance rapide, ainsi que celle des maisons d'hôtes traditionnelles appelées "Riad" (avec jardin) et ''Dar''(sans jardin).La ville est très connue pour son artisanat très riche, dont le savoir-faire est jalousement gardé et transmis de père en fils depuis des générations.Fès est traditionnellement présente dans l'industrie textile avec la transformation du coton et de la laine.Située dans la riche plaine du Saïs, Fès a une importante industrie agroalimentaire.Ces dernières décennies, le tourisme n'a cessé de se développer (1 million de visiteurs par an)[réf. nécessaire] et est devenu un important facteur économique. Fès propose des manifestations culturelles telles que le Festival de Fès des musiques sacrées du monde au mois de juin de chaque année. De nombreux étrangers se sont installés à Fès et ont ouvert des maisons d'hôtes.En effet, l'ancienne médina est riche en patrimoine. Ses remparts, ses châteaux, ses mosquées, ses rues aux mille senteurs, ses souks qui n'existent nulle part ailleurs. On peut ainsi faire le tour de la ville en passant par les portes légendaires de Bab El Guissa vers le nord-est, Bab Ftouh vers l'est sur la route de Taza, qui mène d'ailleurs aux thermes de Sidi Harazem, Bab Jdid, la porte d'entrée la plus proche pour accéder aux souks. Bab Boujloud vers l'Ouest. Chacune de ces portes a ses caractéristiques avec notamment Bab Boujloud, la porte caractérisée par la mosquée qui porte le même nom, et les deux principales rues qu'elle dessert, La Talaa al kbira où on peut apprécier la Medersa Bouananya et ses horloges suspendues, et la Talaa as sghira où on peut apprécier les bouquinistes. Ces deux rues mènent aux souks d'al Attarine (souk aux épices et au henné) de même que vers le quartier Moulay Idriss où on peut voir le mausolée du fondateur de la ville (deuxième roi de la dynastie idrisside, descendants de Mahomet), mais aussi les tanneries de Guernize et celles plus loin de Blida (Chow ara).La mosquée Al Qarawiyyĭn est la jumelle de celle de Kairouan (Sidi Oqba). Cette grande mosquée connue dans le monde entier est située au centre des souks de l'ancienne médina et toutes les portes précédemment citées y mènent.La place Chemaïne est connue pour le commerce des dattes et des noix mais aussi pour son artisanat (Ceinture sertie au fil doré dit de Sicile) et d'autres effets utilisés par les mariées. Parallèlement à cette place, de l'autre côté on trouve la place Seffarine qui est connue pour ses fabriques de plateaux de cuivre et de bronze travaillés à la main. Dans cette même place existe la grande et prestigieuse bibliothèque Al Qarawiyyĭn qui abrite des dizaines de milliers d'ouvrages inédits.L'ancienne médina est traversée par une rivière légendaire qui divise la ville en deux parties dites Aadwa. Ces deux rives datent du premier roi idrisside Idriss Ier qui s'est installé sur l'une des rives, son neveu était venu s'installer sur la rive opposée après l'assassinat de son père. On peut avoir une vue panoramique en prenant la route menant de Bab did à Bab Ftouh juste au pied de la colline qui abrite Borj Dhab ou encore par l'autre rive du côté de Bab el Guissa. La vue est d'ailleurs imprenable. De là on peut définir et identifier les différents quartiers de la médina de même qu'on peut apercevoir tous ses minarets commençant par celui de la mosquée Al Qarawiyyĭn.Plusieurs medersas (écoles) peuvent être visitées avec notamment la medersa d'al Attarine, celle de Ras ech Charratine, la medersa Bou Inaniya, la medersa de Seffarine). En effet, la ville de Fès jusqu'aux années 1960 a été connue comme la capitale culturelle et spirituelle du royaume avant d'être détrônée par Rabat qui abrite la grande université Mohamed V créée dans les années 1960.La maison fassie se distingue par la qualité de son architecture et le professionnalisme des artisans qui l'ont construite. Les grandes familles fassies y demeurent et le système patriarcal est resté en vigueur jusqu'aux années 1970. Le départ des jeunes pour continuer leurs études à Rabat ou à l'étranger où sont en vogue de nouvelles carrières (médecine, architecture) a été à l'origine de la dislocation de ce système de famille. Actuellement[Quand ?] de nombreuses maisons sont désertées par leurs propriétaires ou vendues et rachetées et habitées par plus d'une famille par maison.En effet, ces maisons traditionnelles, plusieurs fois centenaires pour certaines ne peuvent plus être entretenues et souvent restent en ruine. D'où la nécessité de sauvegarder ce patrimoine unique. Les rues sont étroites, les murs s'effondrent par endroits. Le visiteur est étonné de voir ces murs soutenus par de gros madriers dans les environs du quartier de la mosquée Al Qarawiyyĭn et du mausolée Moulay Idriss. Le classement par l'Unesco de la ville de Fès au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité semble aujourd'hui dérisoire car ce patrimoine risque de se perdre petit à petit si rien n'est fait pour le sauver.Les dix-huit quartiers de Fès el Bali, connus pour la plupart depuis l’époque des Mérinides, ont été répertoriés par le biographe Mohamed B. Jaafar Kettani dans son livre Salwat alanfas. Il s’agit des quartiers suivants :Sous le règne des Almohades, Fès comptait 785 mosquées[36]. Aujourd'hui, bien que leur nombre soit moindre, les mosquées historiques de Fès demeurent nombreuses.D’après les statistiques de l’ADER (Agence pour le développement et pour la réhabilitation de la médina de Fès), la ville de Fès compte 115 fondouks. La situation actuelle de ces fondouks est comme suit : 16 fondouks en bon état, 71 détériorés, 15 menacés et 13 en ruines.Fontaines de FèsCapitale culturelle et spirituelle du Maroc, Fès est une ville millénaire. En la parcourant, on peut facilement se laisser emporter à travers son histoire, grâce à ses nombreuses mosquées, médersas, fondouks, fontaines et salles d'ablution, jardins historiques, murailles et remparts, portes fortifiées, mellah et synagogues, manufactures, mausolées, palais et riads, places et souks. Des Idrissides aux Alaouites, des Andalous aux Juifs, toutes les dynasties et tous les peuples ont laissé leur empreinte sur la ville.Ces dernières années de nombreux monuments ont été restaurés, comme la médersa El-Attarîn, la médersa Bou-Inania (XIVe siècle), la Magana (une horloge hydraulique unique au monde) et la bibliothèque de la mosquée Quaraouiyine. Cette dernière possède de très rares manuscrits écrits par de célèbres savants comme Ibn Rochd (Averroès) ou Ibn Khaldoun. Appelés "monuments verts", les jardins du palais Batha, créés au XIXe siècle par le sultan alaouite Moulay Hassan Ier et celui du Riad Moqri datant du début XXe siècle ont retrouvé leur végétation.Aujourd'hui la médina est le principal pôle d'attraction. Toutefois, quelques centres culturels et galeries voient le jour : le Centre culturel municipal Agdal (près de la place Florence) compte une salle de spectacles et une galerie d'exposition.Musique andalouse / le malhoun / principalement موسيقى الآلة الأندلسية المغربية, on trouve également plusieurs manifestation culturelles dans ce cadre d'où: مهرجان موسيقى الآلة الأندلسية المغربية chaque année dans le mois de mars.Fès a fait la grandeur de la céramique marocaine. D’origine très ancienne, les céramiques de Fès sont reconnaissables par leur décor à dominante bleu de cobalt, couleur de la ville, et les motifs qui allient le vert et le jaune or. Véritables artistes, les maîtres-potiers de Fès développent depuis des siècles un sens subtil de l’ornementation émaillée. Encore de nos jours, les ateliers de la ville impériale restent inégalés pour l’élégance et la finesse de leur production.C’est à Fès qu’est née la céramique émaillée et vernissée. En 814, Idriss II accueille dans sa nouvelle capitale des milliers d’immigrés venus de Cordoue. Parmi ces hommes se trouvent des artisans expérimentés qui ont apporté avec eux des techniques alors inconnues au Maroc. La poterie n’est plus seulement utilitaire, les pièces deviennent des œuvres d’art et font la renommée de la ville dans toute l’Afrique du Nord. À l’époque des Almohades, au XIIIe siècle, on ne recensait pas moins de 180 potiers à Fès. On y dénombre encore aujourd’hui une cinquantaine de patrons potiers qui emploient chacun quatre ou cinq ouvriers et apprentis.La ville de Fès est reconnue pour son expertise dans l’art du zellige, un type de mosaïque ornementale. Cet art traditionnel marocain qui se transmet de génération en génération est aujourd’hui l’une des grandes fiertés de la ville.De nombreux artisans mâalems y sont présents, et les proches carrières d’argile permettent d’avoir une matière première de qualité à portée de main. Le zellige de Fès a d’ailleurs été enregistré auprès de l’Organisation mondiale de la propriété intellectuelle au nom du Maroc[37].Lignes urbaines et interurbaines :Le schéma directeur de développement de lignes TGV au Maroc, prévoit la construction à moyen terme d'une ligne à grande vitesse appelée « Maghrébine » reliant Rabat, Meknès, Fès et Oujda, la ville frontalière à l'Algérie[39].Un projet de tramway est en cours d'étude[40].La ville de Fés est représentée par deux équipes de football, la première est le Wydad athlétique de Fès " WAF" fondée en 1948 est joue actuellement[Quand ?] en deuxième division du championnat marocain, la seconde est le Maghreb Association sportive de Fès (MAS) (en arabe : المغرب الرياضي الفاسي) qui est un club omnisports marocain fondé en 1946.Le MAS est la première équipe marocaine à atteindre les seizièmes de finale de la Coupe de France en 1954 contre Red Star à l'époque à Paris.Le MAS est un l'un des clubs les plus titrés du royaume, avec un palmarès remarquable :Championnat du Maroc : (4)Championnat du Maroc (D2) : (2)Coupe du Trône : (2)Le Complexe sportif de Fès est un stade de football localisé dans la ville de Fès et plus précisément sur la route menant à Sefrou, il est d'un style architectural typiquement marocain. Situé sur une superficie de 40 hectares, le complexe sportif de Fès peut accueillir 37 000 spectateurs tous assis. Il est doté d'une piste d'athlétisme en tartan outre des annexes susceptibles d'accueillir des compétitions de haut niveau.Le principal club de football de la ville est le Maghreb Association sportive Fès (MAS). Ce dernier a remporté quatre championnats (1965, 1979, 1981 et 1985) et quatre coupes du trône (1980, 1988, 2011, 2016). C'est le seul club marocain à avoir disputé les 1/16 de finale de la coupe de France pendant le protectorat. Il a produit de très grands joueurs: Benzakour, Benchekroun, Hamid Lahbabi, Labied, Zemmouri, Hazzaa, Zahraoui, Guezzar, Tazi, Moulay Driss, Jennane et bien d'autres. Il est connu par son école des gardiens de buts et possède un public engagé et discipliné.Après l'indépendance, et au cours du premier championnat organisé sous l'égide de la FRMF en octobre 1956, le MAS est l'une des premières équipes à gagner sa place parmi l'élite.La ville de Fès possède un autre club de football qui est le Wydad Athletic de Fès (WAF).Il existe de nombreux autres clubs sportifs appartenant à des disciplines variées telles le basket-ball, tennis, handball.Sur les autres projets Wikimedia :--- Content from  ---Le Centre du patrimoine mondial occupe une position de tout premier plan dans les efforts fournis par la communauté internationale en matière de protection et de préservation.Partenariats pour la conservation du patrimoine mondialAssurer la préservation de ces sites remarquables est une mission de plus en plus difficile en ces temps où les sites sont exposés aux effets de l’urbanisation incontrôlée, des pratiques de tourisme non durables, de la négligence, des calamités naturelles, de la pollution, de l’instabilité politique et des conflits.Nos partenaires Faites un donFaites une recherche à travers les informations du Centre du patrimoine mondial.Founded in the 9th century, Fez reached its height in the 13th–14th centuries under the Marinids, when it replaced Marrakesh as the capital of the kingdom. The urban fabric and the principal monuments in the medina – madrasas, fondouks, palaces, residences, mosques and fountains - date from this period. Although the political capital of Morocco was transferred to Rabat in 1912, Fez has retained its status as the country's cultural and spiritual centre.La description est disponible sous licence CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0Fondée au IXe siècle, Fès a connu sa période faste aux XIIIe et XIVe siècles, sous la dynastie mérinide, quand elle supplanta Marrakech comme capitale du royaume. Le tissu urbain et les monuments essentiels de la médina remontent à cette période : médersa, fondouks, palais et demeures, mosquées, fontaines, etc. En dépit du transfert du siège de la capitale à Rabat, en 1912, elle garde son statut de capitale culturelle et spirituelle du pays.La description est disponible sous licence CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0تأسّست مدينة فاس في القرن التاسع وفيها أقدم جامعة في العالم. عرفت فاس عصرها الذهبي في القرنَيْن الثالث عشر والرابع عشر تحت حكم المرينيّين عندما أصبحت عاصمة المملكة بدلاً من مراكش. ويعود النسيج المدني والنصب الأساسيّة إلى تلك الحقبة: المدرسة والفنادق والقصور والبيوت والمساجد والينابيع. وبالرغم من نقل مركز العاصمة إلى الرباط في العام 1912، حافظت فاس على موقعها كعاصمة ثقافيّة وروحيّة للبلاد.source: UNESCO/CPELa description est disponible sous licence CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0非斯城建于公元9世纪，那里有世界上最早建立的大学。在公元13世纪至14世纪时，非斯代替马拉柯什成为马里尼德王国的首都，从而到达了它的鼎盛时期。聚居区中的城市建筑和主要遗迹都可以追溯到那个时期，其中包括伊斯兰学校、集市、宫殿、民居、清真寺、喷泉等等。尽管国家的政治首都于1912年迁到了拉巴特，但非斯仍然是最主要的文化中心和宗教中心。source: UNESCO/CPELa description est disponible sous licence CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0Основанный в IХ в. и имевший старейший в мире университет, город Фес достиг своего расцвета в ХIII-ХIV вв. при Маринидах, когда он стал столицей королевства вместо Марракеша.

La ville primitive comportait deux grands quartiers fortifiés et séparés par l'oued Fès : la rive des Andalous et celle des Kaïrouanais. Au XIe siècle, les Almoravides réunirent la ville à l'intérieur d'un seul rempart et, sous la dynastie des Almohades (XIIe et XIIIe siècles), la ville primitive (Fès el-bali) prenait déjà ses dimensions actuelles. Sous les Mérinides (XIIIe- XVe siècle), une ville nouvelle (Fès Jedid) fut fondée (en 1276) à l'Ouest de l'ancienne (Fès El-Bali). Elle abrite le palais royal, le siège de l'armée, des fortifications et des quartiers résidentiels. Dès cette époque, les deux entités de la médina de Fès évoluent en symbiose constituant l'une des grandes métropoles islamiques incarnant une grande variété de formes architecturales et de paysages urbains. Elles comportent un nombre considérable de monuments à caractère religieux, civil et militaire qui matérialisent une culture aux multiples influences. Cette architecture est caractérisée par des techniques de construction et de décoration développées sur une période de plus de dix siècles, et où se sont mêlés les connaissances et savoirs-faire locaux et des inspirations extérieures diverses (andalouses, orientales, et africaines). La médina de Fès est considérée comme l'une des villes historiques les plus vastes et les mieux conservées du monde arabo-musulman. L'espace urbain non carrossable y conserve la majorité de ses fonctions et attributions d'origine. Elle ne représente pas seulement un patrimoine architectural, archéologique et urbain exceptionnel, mais elle véhicule aussi un mode de vie, des savoirs-faire et une culture qui persistent et se renouvellent malgré les divers effets des mutations des sociétés modernes.Critère (ii) : La médina de Fès constitue un témoignage vivant d'une cité florissante de l'Occident méditerranéen ayant exercé une influence considérable principalement du XIIe au XVe siècle, sur le développement de l'architecture, des arts monumentaux et de l'aménagement urbain, notamment en Afrique du Nord, en Andalousie et en Afrique sub-saharienne. Fès Jedid (la Neuve), s'est inspirée du modèle urbain antérieur de Marrakech.Critère (v) : La médina de Fès constitue un exemple éminent d'une ville médiévale créée aux tous premiers siècles de l'islamisation du Maroc et matérialisant un type original d'établissement humain et d'occupation du territoire traditionnel représentatifs de la culture citadine marocaine sur une longue période historique (du IXe au début du XXe siècle). Le parcellaire ancien avec sa haute densité de monuments à caractère religieux, civil et militaire de la médina sont les témoins de cette culture et le résultat de son interaction avec les diverses couches de peuplement qui ont déterminé la grande variété de formes architecturales et le paysage urbain.Intégrité (2009)La délimitation du bien inscrit sur la Liste du patrimoine mondial est claire et appropriée et elle inclue tout le tissu urbain et les murailles. La zone de protection définie par les arrêtés du 23 août 1923 et 29 octobre 1954 protège de manière adéquate l'intégrité visuelle. La médina de Fès comprend un tissu urbain qui est demeuré remarquablement homogène et intact au cours des siècles. Les principaux problèmes que l'on constate concernent la vétusté des édifices et la surdensité de l'occupation de l'espace. Les abords de la médina sont un élément indispensable à la qualité de l'aspect visuel de son environnement et doivent être maintenus zone non constructible. Ils sont vulnérables aux pressions du développement urbain incontrôlé.Authenticité (2009)Tous les éléments clés qui composent le bien reflètent de manière complète et claire la valeur universelle exceptionnelle. La survivance des savoir-faire architecturaux traditionnels, notamment en matière des métiers de la construction et du décor architectural, est un atout majeur dans le maintien des valeurs du bien. Le ministère de la Culture s'efforce non sans difficultés d'amener les différents intervenants à respecter l'authenticité du bien.Besoins en matière de protection et de gestion (2009)La médina de Fès est protégée par des textes législatifs locaux et nationaux visant sa protection et renforçant, au niveau local, son inscription sur la Liste du patrimoine mondial, notamment le décret n°2-81-25 du 22 octobre 1981 pour l'application de la loi n°22-80 relative à la conservation des monuments historiques et des sites, des inscriptions, des objets d'art et d'antiquité.Prenant compte de la vulnérabilité du bien, l'État a adopté un Plan d'aménagement de la médina en 2001. La périodicité de réévaluation du plan est de 10 ans. Il comporte des dispositions spécifiques pour le secteur ancien, et il est appelé à rationaliser et à organiser les interventions urbaines demandées. Dans le cadre d'un programme de promotion touristique régionale, les autorités locales ont entrepris des actions de sauvegarde des maisons menaçant ruine et de réhabilitation des monuments remarquables de la médina. La mise en œuvre de ce programme est confiée à l'Agence de Dé-densification et de Réhabilitation de la médina de Fès. L'inspection des monuments historiques relève du ministère de la culture et assure le suivi et l'encadrement de ces projets conformément aux normes nationales et internationales en matière de conservation des monuments historiques.Les dossiers de proposition d’inscription produits par les États parties sont publiés par le Centre du patrimoine mondial sur son site Internet et/ou dans des documents de travail afin de garantir la transparence, l’accès à l’information et de faciliter la préparation d’analyses comparatives par d’autres États parties soumissionnaires.Le contenu de chaque dossier de proposition d’inscription relève de la responsabilité exclusive de l'État partie concerné. La publication d’un dossier de proposition d’inscription, y compris les cartes et les noms, ne saurait être interprétée comme exprimant une prise de position de la part du Comité du patrimoine mondial ou du Secrétariat de l'UNESCO à propos de l’histoire ou du statut juridique d'un pays, d'un territoire, d'une ville ou d'une zone, ou de ses frontières.par année1 protection / 3 élémentsLire plus sur les synergies--- Content from  ---Error scraping  404 Client Error: Not Found for url:
